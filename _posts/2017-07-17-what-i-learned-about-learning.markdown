The ability to learn new things is the most important skill that we can develop as technologists.  
Our job is to solve problems. In addition, the issues we face are usually quite different from one another.  
The more you know, more effective, and as consequence, more valuable you will be.

It is astounding how we are usually carefree with our learning process.
I spent a time in my career learning things by chance.
Nevertheless, understanding and improving how you learn is an investment that pays off.
Here are a couple of things that help me when I am learning.

## Understand the history
Learning the history behind your subject will bring you awareness.
Understanding the context in which something was created can be surprising.
Sometimes the principles that led to something that we consider innovative were documented a long time ago.
Learning about the past will increase your knowledge breadth, and how does it fit in the big picture.
After this process, you may even get a few ideas about how things will evolve.

## Understand the limits
When we approach a problem, our mind spends a considerable amount of time defining possible solutions.
To reduce this cogntive load, it helps to understand what sets of problems we can solve with what we are learning.
This will create shortcuts that will help us evaluate when we should be using these new tools.

This thing you are studying probably can’t solve all the problems in the world.
Given that, it’s equally important to understand which problems it can’t solve.
If we fail to do that, we may end up forcing our recently acquired knowledge on a problem just because you got stoked with what we learned.

## Practice
When we start using our recently acquired knowledge to solve a problem, it is not immediately pleasant.
Expect to struggle for some time before the pieces starts to fit together.
After a while the feeling of progress kicks in, and this sensation brings motivation to keep on going.
When we don't give up, we are awarded with the ability to apply our new skills effortlessly.

## Talk
When we have a conversation with someone about what we are learning, our knowledge to solidifies.
We don’t always have to engage in a explicit Mentor Mentee relationship.
At any stage of the process we can find someone that is inteterested in the same topic and just have a conversation.

## Parting thoughts
These are the principles I found that works for me.
I hope that after reading this you will spend a little time thinkning about how do you learn.
In the next post about this subject I will talk about the practices. Stay tunned!
